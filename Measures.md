The intuition behind the F1 score is that it provides a single, balanced metric that handles the trade-off between precision and recall in classification problems.

Here's why F1 score is useful and what it represents intuitively:
1. Balance between precision and recall:

Precision measures how many of your positive predictions were actually positive (avoiding false alarms)
Recall measures how many of the actual positives you caught (avoiding missed detections)

2. Harmonic mean, not arithmetic mean:

F1 is the harmonic mean of precision and recall: 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)
This is crucial because the harmonic mean punishes extreme imbalances between precision and recall
If either precision or recall is very low, the F1 score will be closer to the lower value

3. When F1 is useful:

In imbalanced datasets where accuracy would be misleading
When both false positives and false negatives have significant costs
When you need a single metric to optimize

4. Real-world interpretation:

High F1: Your model is good at finding the positive cases (high recall) without falsely labeling negative cases as positive (high precision)
Low F1: Your model is either missing many positive cases or generating many false positives (or both)

You can see this illustrated in the interactive component - if you set either precision or recall close to zero, the F1 score drops dramatically. Only when both metrics are high does the F1 score approach their values, rewarding balanced performance.

For example, try these scenarios in the explorer:

If precision = 90% but recall = 10%, F1 will be about 18%
If both precision and recall = 50%, F1 will be 50%
Only when both metrics are high (e.g., 80%+) will the F1 score also be high

This makes F1 particularly valuable in applications like medical diagnosis, fraud detection, or content filtering where both false positives and false negatives carry real costs.
